Comments:

1. Make sure to check-in release notes so that I can add comments (I had to create one)
2. User stories are not updated on the spec. document. 
3. Your team is lagging behind in both implementation and testing. You should start putting in a lot of time/work, if you would like to complete the project in time. Don't wait till the last minute to get things done. I hope to see some progess made in the next release.
4. Continue to do code review, document/comment any code you write, start writing test cases.
5. You should have some kind database set-up by the next release.

Good Luck! Nice job on the design review presentation.
